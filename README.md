# MIPS_Project
Worked with a team of three to write the core part of a mini processor simulation called MySPIM using the C programming language on a UNIX platform. This project simulates the main functionalities of the MIPS processor as well as the various actions of the data path and control signals cycle-by-cycle as a single-cycle data path.  


** Instructions on specifications of program as well the details on running the program are highlighted on the ProjectGuideline.pdf **
